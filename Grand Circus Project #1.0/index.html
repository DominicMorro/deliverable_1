    <p class="overview"> Hello, I am Dominic but you can just call me Dom. I like to play video games and play guitar and more recently I've picked up coding. I've always been more on the creative side and originally wanted to get into graphic design and have self-taught myself a majority of the Adobe suite.</p>
<h2 id="my-start">How I got my start</h2>
    <p>I became interested in coding about a year ago when I started deep diving into coding youtube channels such as Micheal Reeves and William Osman. I really enjoy creating something from scratch with practical use and coding is essential for nearly everything I like to do in my downtime. Getting a better understanding of how things work especially tehnology and web developement really interest me. When I first attempted to code it was for a Minecraft computer mod and it required LUA to code so I have a little bit of LUA experience not that it will come handy.  </p>
    <p>I got suggested Grand Circus by a friend of mine, actually a couple friends suggested it and I've always been curious not just about boot camps but coding as well. Being someone who likes to expand their skill set I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to not only learn coding but also gain experience. </p>
